# graph-info

**Interactive infrastructure visualization tool** — Maps your databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and storage services (S3/MinIO) as an interactive graph with real-time health monitoring.

## What It Does

**graph-info** automatically discovers and visualizes your infrastructure components as an interactive graph:

- **PostgreSQL**: Discovers databases, tables, and foreign key relationships
- **MongoDB**: Maps databases and collections
- **S3/MinIO**: Lists buckets and folder prefixes
- **Real-time health**: WebSocket-powered live status updates every 5 seconds
- **Zero configuration**: Just provide connection strings — discovery is automatic

Point it at your infrastructure and instantly see the topology.

## Quick Start (Docker)

The fastest way to try graph-info is with Docker Compose, which includes PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MinIO with sample data:

```bash
# Clone and start all services
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-info.git
cd graph-info
make docker-up

# Services will be available at:
# - Frontend:      http://localhost:3000
# - Backend API:   http://localhost:8080
# - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001
```

The Docker environment includes seed data so you can see the graph immediately.

**To stop:**
```bash
make docker-down
```

**To rebuild after code changes:**
```bash
make docker-build && make docker-up
```

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25.6+
- Node.js 18+ (or Bun)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or S3 (optional, for testing adapters)

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
cd binary
go mod download

# Copy sample config and edit connection strings
cp ../conf/config.sample.yaml ../conf/config.yaml
# Edit conf/config.yaml with your connection details

# Run the backend
go run ./cmd/app/main.go
```

The backend API will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd webui
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Using Make

```bash
make install       # Install all dependencies
make dev          # Run backend + frontend concurrently
make build        # Build production binaries
make test         # Run all tests
make lint         # Run Go vet and fmt checks
```

---

## Configuration

graph-info uses a YAML configuration file at `conf/config.yaml`. See `conf/config.sample.yaml` for examples.

### PostgreSQL Adapter

```yaml
connections:
  - name: postgres
    type: postgres
    dsn: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable"
```

### MongoDB Adapter

```yaml
connections:
  - name: mongodb
    type: mongodb
    uri: "mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017"
```

### S3 / AWS Adapter

```yaml
connections:
  - name: s3
    type: s3
    region: us-east-1
    access_key_id: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    secret_access_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

### MinIO / S3-Compatible Adapter

```yaml
connections:
  - name: minio
    type: s3
    region: us-east-1
    endpoint: "http://localhost:9000"
    access_key_id: minioadmin
    secret_access_key: minioadmin
```

**Important:** This tool is intended for authorized infrastructure visualization and monitoring of systems you own or have permission to access. Do not use it to scan or access systems without authorization.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (Go)

```
Config (YAML)
    ↓
Adapter Registry
    ├─ PostgreSQL Adapter → Discovers tables + foreign keys
    ├─ MongoDB Adapter    → Discovers collections
    └─ S3 Adapter         → Discovers buckets + prefixes
    ↓
Graph Model (Nodes + Edges)
    ↓
REST API + WebSocket (Real-time health)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Adapters**: Implement the `Adapter` interface to discover infrastructure
- **Registry**: Manages adapters, creates service-level parent nodes, aggregates graph data
- **Cache**: 30-second TTL with singleflight pattern to prevent thundering herd
- **WebSocket**: Streams health updates every 5 seconds

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- **React Flow**: Interactive graph visualization with pan/zoom
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Automatically positions nodes by parent-child relationships
- **Node Inspector**: Side panel showing detailed metadata and connections
- **WebSocket Hook**: Real-time health updates without polling

### Node Hierarchy

```
Service Node (postgres/mongodb/s3)
    └─ Database/Bucket Node
        └─ Table/Collection/Prefix Node
```

Edges represent relationships (foreign keys, contains, etc.).

## API Reference

### GET `/api/graph`
Returns the full infrastructure graph (nodes + edges).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "service-postgres",
        "type": "postgres",
        "name": "postgres",
        "metadata": { "adapter": "postgres" },
        "health": "healthy"
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge-1",
        "source": "service-postgres",
        "target": "pg-mydb",
        "type": "contains",
        "label": "contains"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/node/{id}`
Returns details for a specific node.

### GET `/api/health`
Returns adapter health status (ok/degraded/error).

### WS `/websocket`
Streams real-time health updates.

**Message format:**
```json
{
  "type": "health_update",
  "nodeId": "postgres",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Adding a New Adapter

1. **Create adapter package** in `binary/internal/adapters/{name}/`
2. **Implement the `Adapter` interface:**
   ```go
   type Adapter interface {
       Connect(config ConnectionConfig) error
       Discover() ([]nodes.Node, []edges.Edge, error)
       Health() (HealthMetrics, error)
       Close() error
   }
   ```
3. **Register in factory** (`binary/internal/config/factory.go`)
4. **Add node type** in `binary/internal/graph/nodes/nodes.go`
5. **Update frontend types** in `webui/src/types/graph.ts`
6. **Add icon** in `webui/src/components/graph/CustomNode.tsx`

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidance.
