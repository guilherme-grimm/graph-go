# Contributing to graph-go

---

## Code of Conduct

This project is intended for legitimate infrastructure visualization and monitoring purposes. Contributors must:

- Only develop features for authorized infrastructure access
- Not contribute code designed to circumvent authentication or authorization
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any security issues discovered
- Respect the intended use case: helping engineers visualize and monitor systems they own or have permission to access

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25.6+
- Node.js 24+ (or Bun)
- Docker (required for integration tests)

### Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/graph-go.git
cd graph-go
git remote add upstream https://github.com/guilherme-grimm/graph-go.git
```

### Local Development Setup

Run backend and frontend in separate processes. Vite proxies `/api`, `/websocket`, and `/health` to the backend on :8080, so the SPA at :5173 hot-reloads against a live API.

```bash
make install    # Go modules + npm deps
make dev        # backend on :8080, Vite dev server on :5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` for the dev UI.

For the repo-scoped seeded onboarding flow that mirrors the CLI-first product direction:

```bash
go run ./cmd/app demo
```

For a single-process check that mirrors production (SPA embedded in the binary):

```bash
make build      # builds frontend bundle, embeds it, builds binary
./bin/graph-go serve  # or just ./bin/graph-go
```

### Make Targets

```
make install            # Install all dependencies
make dev                # Run backend + Vite dev server concurrently
make build              # Build the embedded production binary
make build-backend-only # Skip frontend rebuild (fast Go iteration)
make test               # Unit tests + TS type-check
make lint               # golangci-lint
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching

- `main` — Production-ready code
- `feature/your-feature-name` — New features
- `fix/bug-description` — Bug fixes

### Code Style

**Go:** Follow standard conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`). Descriptive names, early returns, functions under 50 lines.

**TypeScript:** Strict mode, no `any`, functional components with hooks, components under 200 lines.

### Before Committing

```bash
go fmt ./... && go vet ./...
go test ./...                                                    # unit tests
go test -tags=integration -timeout=5m ./internal/adapters/...    # integration tests (requires Docker)
cd webui && npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Adding a New Adapter

See [README.md](README.md#adding-a-new-adapter) for the full step-by-step guide. Adapters live in `internal/adapters/{name}/`.

## Adding a New Discoverer

See [README.md](README.md#adding-a-new-discoverer) for the full step-by-step guide. Discoverers live in `internal/discovery/{name}/` and implement the `Discoverer` interface defined in `internal/discovery/discovery.go`. Existing examples: `discovery/docker/` (adapter-oriented) and `discovery/kubernetes/` (topology-oriented).

### Integration Tests (Required)

Every adapter **must** have integration tests. This is non-negotiable — it's how we ensure adapters work against real infrastructure, not just in theory.

1. Create `{name}_integration_test.go` in your adapter package
2. Add `//go:build integration` as the first line
3. Use `TestMain` with [testcontainers-go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/) to start a real instance of the service
4. Seed the container with representative data (tables, indices, keys, buckets, etc.)
5. Call `adaptertest.RunContractTests` — this validates your adapter against the shared contract (node/edge integrity, health metrics, connect/close lifecycle)
6. Add adapter-specific tests for any unique behavior (filtering, ID format, metadata)

Example pattern (see any existing adapter test for reference):

```go
//go:build integration

package myadapter

import (
    "github.com/guilherme-grimm/graph-go/internal/adapters"
    "github.com/guilherme-grimm/graph-go/internal/adapters/adaptertest"
    // testcontainers module + driver imports
)

var (
    testAdapter adapters.Adapter
    testConfig  adapters.ConnectionConfig
)

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
    // 1. Start container with testcontainers-go
    // 2. Seed data
    // 3. Connect adapter
    // 4. m.Run()
    // 5. Cleanup
}

func TestContract(t *testing.T) {
    adaptertest.RunContractTests(t, testAdapter,
        func() adapters.Adapter { return New() },
        testConfig,
        adaptertest.ContractOpts{
            MinNodes:           ...,
            MinEdges:           ...,
            RootNodeType:       "...",
            ChildNodeTypes:     []string{"..."},
            RequiredHealthKeys: []string{"status", ...},
        },
    )
}
```

Run your tests with:

```bash
go test -tags=integration -v ./internal/adapters/{name}/
```

## Use Scope

**Intended:** New adapters, UI improvements, performance optimizations, bug fixes, documentation.

**Not Accepted:** Features that bypass auth, unauthorized scanning tools, or code that violates the intended use case.
